# interlacedstencilmaker
This program will take a BMP image as input and produce 6 OBJ files that relate to each of the 3 primary colours, 2 for each. Each OBJ is to be 3D printed and used as a spray stencil against black card. 

2 stencils are required for each colour as supporting bars are inserted into the stencil on alternating lines, the 'top' stencil will be even numbered Y lines, the 'bottom' stencil will be odd numbered Y lines. This makes the stencils themselves interlaced.

I use a 0.4mm nozzle, smaller will increase the time required to print, larger will decrease the maximum number of pixels you can represent. A single stencil will take about 12 hours, so 3 total days to print all 6 OBJ files for a given image. These numbers are representative of 220mmx220mm stencil (the max size I can print on an Ender 3.)
